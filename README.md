# Plain-vanillaJS-boilerplate-with-Bootstrap
Just a way to start your project without having to deal with getting the correct dependencies. Uses the full bootstrap so you can code locally without internet.

My inspiration came from me being frustrated at not being able to find a simple solution to have BootStrap 4 automatically included with all the features so I could code right away and not deal with configuration stuff.
